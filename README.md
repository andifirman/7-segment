# 7-segment
In this repository, i'll show you how to access single 7 segment without any pcb. So, you must wiring the jumper into 7 segment one by one. Good luck!

Ah! Don't forget to check your 7 segment, is that common anode or common cathode. Because some wiring are different between anode and cathode type. I also include both of them. So, you can enjoy and wiring easily.
